HostID Impersonation Container for FlexLM.
================

This container is useful when moving a FlexLM to a new server is
desired without having to re-register the new host.

In this case, spoofhost.domain.com is a physical host that has 
previously hosted a license file, but the service needs to
be moved to another arbitrary host.
